# Snakes-and-Ladders

As the name suggests, the program is about the well-known board game "snakes and ladders".

When you run the program and click on play, you can design the board to play with, and indicate the number of players. The game follows the same rules as the original board game, the ladders allow the player to move faster between squares and the snakes move the player backwards. At the end of each game, the winning player will get a score to enter a leaderboard, which is sorted according to that score.
